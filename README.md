## [From Face to Natural Image: Learning Real Degradation for Blind Image Super-Resolution](#)
>#### __Note: I am preparing the codes by using [BasicSR](https://github.com/XPixelGroup/BasicSR) for easily and effectively training. Please stay tuned.__ 

<img src="./GithubImgs/PipelineE.png">
<p align="center">Overview of our ReDegNet. (a) The DegNet for learning the degradation representation. (b) The SynNet for synthesizing the LQ image with the degradation presentation $\Omega$ from DegNet. (c) The HQ natural image together with the degradation representation $\Omega^{Rea}_f$ sampled from the real degradation pool are taken into SynNet to generate their synthetic LQ one. Best view it by zooming in the screen.</p>
